BiasBuddy is a Google Chrome extension that utilises natural language processing techniques to identify topics, people and keywords within the text of an article. Once extracted, the tool analyses sentiment and consequently informs the user of its findings, sometimes providing them with additional resources especially chosen to broaden the userâ€™s perspective.
